# Day 1 – My Cybersecurity Journey Begins 🔐

Today I completed the TryHackMe **"Introduction to Cyber Security"** room.

## Key Takeaways:
- The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of all digital security.
- Cybersecurity isn’t just about hacking; it includes **prevention**, **monitoring**, and **recovery**.
- I learned about different roles:
  - Red Team (Offensive Security)
  - Blue Team (Defensive Security)
  - GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance)
  - DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)
- Hands-on practice with **Linux basics** and **terminal commands**.

> 🧠 *Quote I’m living by:* “Hack your way in, ethically.”

**Stay tuned for Day 2!**
